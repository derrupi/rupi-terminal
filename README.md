My terminal configuration with hyper and zsh

## installation
I tested this on linux and mac.  

1. Download and install [hyper](https://hyper.is/#installation) 
2. Next, you need to install zsh
	sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
3. After installation zsh you have to set zsh as a default bash. 
	// /bin/zshv
	which zsh 
	// set zsh as default 
	chsh -s /bin/zsh
4. Restart your computer
